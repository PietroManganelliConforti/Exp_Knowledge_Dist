#XAI4KD

In this study, we explored the potential of integrating XAI techniques to enhance the performance of KD in various teacher-student settings. We applied several traditional KD methods, including FitNet, Similarity, SEMCKD, and SimKD, using multiple VGG and ResNet architectures, both as teachers and students. To capture a comprehensive representation of the knowledge within the teacher and student models, we utilized CAM-based XAI techniques, specifically Grad-CAM and Grad-CAM++, thanks to their capacity to represent holistically the network understanding of the inputs with a two-dimensional map.
Our results demonstrate that incorporating XAI into the KD process yields performance improvements of approximately 1% in accuracy across nearly all tested scenarios.
